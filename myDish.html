    <p>My favorite food is pizza! I love pizza because it’s the ultimate comfort food—crispy crust, melty cheese, and endless toppings. <br>You can keep it simple with a classic margherita or go bold with extra veggies or spicy pepperoni. </br> It’s versatile, perfect for any occasion, and the combination of flavors always makes it a go-to favorite for me. Whether it's fresh out of the oven or reheated for a quick snack, pizza never disappoints!</p>
